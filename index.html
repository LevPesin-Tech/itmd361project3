			<h2>About me!</h2>
			<p>My name is Lev, this is my first semester at IIT, I transfered from COD and UIUC.I've been learning coding since high-school but still have a lot to learn of course.
			   Originaly I applied for a Computer Science major, but chose ITM instead because math is pretty cringe. I spent most of the time learning or working as a math teacher. 
			   My favourite sport is soccer and favourite team is Everton.I am from Russia and moved to US 9 years ago.
